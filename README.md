# Chess.py


Hi there! I'm CoderMode, creator of Chess.py
This was a project to learn pygame, and I (With a lot of luck) will update and add Chess AI, which was what made me lose motivation for this "game"

I know there is a lot of bugs and you cannot even play against anyone, not even including the performance becuase of Python, but I have regained intrest for this.
